Josephus Problem(Trick)


The problem presents a scenario where a group of N soldiers is standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The soldiers are numbered 1 to N. The execution process involves the first soldier killing the second soldier, the third soldier killing the fourth soldier, and so on until only one soldier remains. The task is to determine the position of the last surviving soldier.

The algorithm to solve this problem involves converting the number of soldiers, N, to binary code. Once the number is in binary form, the first digit from the left is moved to the rightmost place. The resulting binary code is then converted back to the original number form, and this gives the position of the last surviving soldier.

## Conclusion 
In summary, to solve this problem, we convert the number of soldiers to binary code, move the first digit from the left to the rightmost place, and then convert the resulting binary code back to the original number form. This algorithm provides a simple and efficient way to determine the position of the last surviving soldier in the convoy.
