<b><u><h1>Josephus Problem</h1></u></b>

The Josephus problem is a theoretical problem in computer science, mathematics, and game theory. It is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian who lived in the first century AD. The problem is as follows:

There are n soldiers standing in a circle waiting to be executed. They are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. The execution proceeds around the circle, starting at the first soldier. Each time it is the turn of a soldier to be executed, he kills the soldier next to him in clockwise order and then passes the gun to the next surviving soldier in clockwise order. The process continues until only one soldier is left standing. The problem is to determine the position of the last survivor.
